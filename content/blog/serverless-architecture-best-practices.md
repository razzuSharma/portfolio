# Serverless Architecture: Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

Serverless computing has transformed how we build and deploy applications. This comprehensive guide covers best practices and helps you avoid common pitfalls.

## Understanding Serverless

Serverless doesn't mean no servers—it means you don't manage them. Understanding this fundamental concept is key to successful serverless adoption.

## When to Use Serverless

Serverless is perfect for:
- Event-driven applications
- APIs with variable traffic
- Background processing tasks
- Microservices architectures

## Handling Cold Starts

Cold starts are one of the biggest challenges in serverless. Learn strategies to minimize their impact.

## Cost Optimization

Serverless can be cost-effective, but it requires careful planning and monitoring to avoid unexpected costs.

## Conclusion

Serverless architecture offers incredible scalability and cost benefits when implemented correctly.
