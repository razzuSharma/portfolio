# GraphQL vs REST: Choosing the Right API Architecture

The debate between GraphQL and REST continues. This article helps you understand when to use each approach.

## Understanding REST

REST has been the standard for API design for years. Learn about its principles and best practices.

## Understanding GraphQL

GraphQL provides a more flexible approach to data fetching. Understand its strengths and use cases.

## When to Use Each

- **REST**: Simple CRUD operations, caching is important, standard HTTP methods
- **GraphQL**: Complex data requirements, mobile apps, real-time updates

## Schema Design

Both approaches require careful schema design. Learn best practices for each.

## Conclusion

The choice between GraphQL and REST depends on your specific use case. Both have their place in modern development.
